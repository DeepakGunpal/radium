# Problem Statements

## Week 4 Day 1

- Given an array of string, write a function using **spread syntax** that creates a new array using the given array and adds one string at the start and the other at the end.
For example for a given input [‘Javascript’, ‘Python’, ’Scala’], your function should create a new array - [’Start’, ‘Javascript’, ‘Python’, ’Scala’, ‘End’]. 
**Note:** Don’t iterate over the given array, use spread syntax.
- Given 2 separate arrays of numbers or strings. Write a function using the **spread syntax** that creates 2 new arrays merging the two given arrays in both the possible orders. ﻿
For example, 
Given [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6]. The 2 new arrays created should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]
Or given [‘January', ‘February’, ‘March’] and [‘April’, ‘May’, ‘June’]. The 2 new arrays created should be [‘January', ‘February’, ‘March’, ‘April’, ‘May’, ‘June’] and [‘April’, ‘May’, ‘June’, 'January', ‘February’, ‘March’ ]
- Write a function using the **rest syntax** that can take any number of parameters as input and returns the sum of all the provided numbers.
For example. Your function should work for inputs 1,2 as well as 1,2,3 and 1,2,3,4,5
